 Tutorial 13

 Objective
  - This section explains how to use NetBeans IDE to create a simple RESTful web service. NetBeans IDE generates a skeleton for the application, and you simply need to implement the appropriate methods. We will not develop a test client to consume the service. Instead we will simply be testing it through a browser.
